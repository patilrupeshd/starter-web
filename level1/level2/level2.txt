Sometimes, you get overwhelmed by life and let things fall by the wayside. You don’t mean to do it. It just sort of… happens.

Eventually, you make it to the other side. But then you find yourself filled with the overwhelming desire to figure things out.

So… what now? You can’t say “I’m never going to let this happen again.” because never sure as hell is a mighty long time.

You’ve just got to find the thing that’ll work for you, and then try to do that thing for as long as you can.

Anyway… How about some links?:::::wq
